ADVISOR: Now, then, Mr., uh, Vickstad. How can I help you?
STUDENT: Well, I'm thinking about transferring, but I'm, I'm not sure ... I was hoping you
    could help me make a decision.
ADVISOR: I'll try. Where are you thinking of transferring to? And why do you want to
    leave Kryptos U?
STUDENT: Um...I'm thinking of going to Central University, because it's in my hometown.
    I've uh, been kind of homesick here this year, and I haven't made many friends...I just
    feel so lonely. So, I thought that uh, maybe, it'd be better to be closer to my parents
    and friends and all.
ADVISOR: I see. And would you keep the same major if you transferred? What is itâ€¦
    business administration?
STUDENT: Yeah, I would. The credits I've earned here will transfer to Central. I've
    already checked.
ADVISOR: May I ask why you chose to come to Kryptos University in the first place?
STUDENT: Sure. Um, well, the main reason is you have a great business school. And
    the second reason is that I...I wanted to get away from home.
ADVISOR: You're right, Mr. Vickstad, we do have an excellent business school. But, so
    does Central. The thing is, you've got almost a year under your belt here now. At
    Central, you'll be starting from scratch.
STUDENT: Yeah, I know that. But I'm a little bit familiar with Central, 'cuz I had older friends
    who went there, and I visited it before I came here.
ADVISOR: You know, freshman year is usually the hardest. I remember how homesick
    I was my first year. I'll tell you, I was ready to pack it in after the first two weeks. But
    the longer I stayed, the more comfortable I felt. By senior year, I was glad I chose to stay.
STUDENT: Really? Did it get a lot better your sophomore year?
ADVISOR: Yes, it did. You might well find the same is true for you. Also, even though
    your credits here will transfer, you will have to take extra courses, because Central
    has different requirements. You'll probably have to go to school for an extra year.
STUDENT: Hmm...I hadn't thought about that. I'll have to check into it. Maybe I should
    give it one more year. I mean, it's probably good for me to learn to live away from my
    family and friends, right? It'll make me stronger in the future.
ADVISOR: You can always move back there after you graduate. Of course, by that time
    you may not want to!
STUDENT: Thank you for all your help. I guess I'll find out the exact transfer requirements.
    You've given me a lot to think about.
ADVISOR: Don't mention it. If you feel like you want to talk more, don't hesitate to come
    back and see me.
